# Multi-Layer-Perceptron
A perceptron is a simple neural network model used to make a prediction or decision based on a set of inputs. It belongs to the class of linear classifiers and is one of the simplest neural network models. These are the building blocks of more complex neural networks and can be trained to solve linear classification or prediction problems.
This specific one performs detects patterns in data and sorts the results into categories based on its inputs and specified weights. In the learning process, the weights are updated to improve the classification accuracy.
Based on 28x28 pixel images of a trained network of data loaded to it's ROM for this experiment, the model can modified using any trained network to perform as needed.

This project was designed emulate the above functions on a AMD Zynq 7000 SoC ZC702 Evaluation Kit and is still under development for further improvements.
Xilinx's Vivado design suite was used during the development of the project.
